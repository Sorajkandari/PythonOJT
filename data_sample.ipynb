The Simpson family first appeared on television as the subjects of interstitial \"shorts\" on The Tracey Ullman Show in April of 1987. The Simpsons remained a staple on The Tracey Ullman Show for three seasons until they premiered in their own half-hour series, on December 17, 1989. With the help of Jim Brooks and Sam Simon, Matt Groening's cartoon family turned into an instant success. Set in Springfield, the average American town, the show focuses on the antics and everyday adventures of the Simpson family; Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, as well as a virtual cast of thousands. Since the beginning, the series has been a pop culture icon, attracting hundreds of celebrities to guest star. The show has also made name for itself in its fearless satirical take on politics, media and American life in general.

They are highly resistant to corrosion, and because the steel used has a very high tensile strength, they can be driven by power hammers to great depths. One common misconception is that the dia of the rod has a drastic effect on lowering earth resistance. This is not true! Use the most economical rod that soil conditions will allow you to drive.

It is based on a graph where each node is a word, and edges represent relationships between words which are formed by defining the co-occurrence of words within a moving window of a predetermined size. The algorithm is inspired by PageRank which was used by Google to rank websites. It first Tokenizes and annotates text with Part of Speech (PoS). It only considers single words. However, no n-grams are used, multi-words are reconstructed later. An edge is created if lexical units co-occur within a window of N-words to obtain an unweighted undirected graph. Then it runs the text rank algorithm to rank the words. The most important lexical words are selected and then adjacent keywords are folded into a multi-word keyword.'\n",
